"Trello" project created with typescript and react, and firestore for database

Main features to try when using the site: <br>
- Log in/register either with your own e-mail and password or with your google.
- Create bulletin boards and invite other users to the board.
- The invitation lights up red at the recipient immediately when an invitation to the bulletin board is
sent, where the recipient can accept or decline the invitation.
- Create lists and cards (tasks) on the lists. Lists and cards have
drag-and-drop functions if you want to change the order of the lists or move cards
between lists (ex from ongoing to done)
- Add and remove board members on the cards. Assign cards to yourself or other members.
- Enter time estimation and actual time on the cards.
- See total estimated time and actual time on each board (to the right of the header
on the board side).
- Choose a background image for your bulletin board using pexel's API on “Click
to select random background”. <br>
